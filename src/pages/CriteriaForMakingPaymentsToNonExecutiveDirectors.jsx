                Schedule V read with Regulation 34 (3) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (hereinafter referred as “Listing Regulations”), requires every Company to publish its criteria of making payments to Non- Executive Directors in its annual report. Alternatively, as per Regulation 46 (2) of Listing Regulations, this may be put up on the Company’s website and reference may be drawn thereto in its annual report.<br />
                Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 17(6) (a) of Listing Regulations require the prior approval of the shareholders of a Company for making payment to its Non-Executive Directors (hereinafter referred as “NEDs”).<br />
                However, the requirement of obtaining prior approval of shareholders in general meeting shall not apply to payment of sitting fees to non-executive directors, if made within the limits prescribed under Companies Act, 2013 for payment of sitting fees without approval of the Central Government.<br />
                Accordingly, the following criteria is laid down for Cipco Limited (hereinafter referred as “the Company”).<br />
                In keeping with the above, any fee/remuneration payable to the NEDs of the Company shall abide by the following:

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 break-words">SITTING FEES:</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 break-words">
                The NEDs (which expression includes Independent Directors) may receive remuneration by way of fees for attending meetings of Board or Committee thereof. Provided that the amount of such fees shall not exceed Rupees One lakh per meeting of the Board or Committee or such amount as may be prescribed by the Central Government from time to time.<br />
                In addition, NEDs shall be entitled to reimbursement of travel, lodging, boarding and other expenses actually incurred for participation in Board and Committee meetings.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 break-words">
                Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 allows a Company to pay remuneration to its NEDs either by way of a monthly payment or at a specified percentage of the net profits of the Company or partly by one way and partly by the other.<br />
                Further, the section also states that where the Company has either Managing Director or Whole-time Director or Manager, then a maximum of 1% of its net profits can be paid as remuneration to its NEDs. In case there is no managing director or whole-time director or manager, then a maximum of 3% of net profit can be paid. Thus, the basis of payment to the NEDs is the net profit of the Company.<br />
