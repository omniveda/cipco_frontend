            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 break-words">3. RISK MANAGEMENT:</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 break-words">
                The risk management process adopted by the Company has been tailored to the business processes of the organization. Broadly categorizing, the process consists of the following stages/steps:<br />
                a) Establishing the Context<br />
                Articulate the objectives and define the external and internal parameters to be taken into account when managing risk, and sets the scope and risk criteria for the remaining process. Understanding the external context is important in order to ensure that the objectives and concerns of external stakeholders are considered when developing risk criteria. The risk management process should be aligned with the organization&#39;s culture, processes, structure and strategy. Internal context is anything within the organization that can influence the way risks will be managed<br />
                b) Risk Assessment (identification, analysis &amp; evaluation)<br />
                Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of problems, or with the problem itself. It is important to identify the risks associated with not pursuing an opportunity. Comprehensive identification is critical, because a risk that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis. Risk is analyzed by determining consequences and their likelihood, and other attributes of the risk. Risk evaluation involves comparing the level of risk found during the analysis process with risk criteria established when the context was considered. Based on this comparison, the need for treatment can be considered.<br />
                Considering business structure, internal and external factors, the Company’s focus is on the following risks which are considered material risks<br />
                a. Financial risks<br />
                b. Operational risks<br />
                c. Sectoral and market-related risks<br />
                d. Sustainability and ESG-related risks<br />
                e. Information and cyber security risks<br />
                f. Legal and compliance risks<br />
                g. Business continuity risks<br />
                To ensure systematic tracking, the Company shall maintain a Risk Register that records identified risks, their categorization, treatment plans, and the person(s) responsible for mitigation.<br />
                c) Risk Treatment (mitigation plan)<br />
                Risk treatment involves selecting one or more options for modifying risks, and implementing those options. Once implemented, treatments provide or modify the controls. Risk treatment involves a cyclical process of Assessing a risk treatment; Deciding whether residual risk levels are tolerable; If not tolerable, generating a new risk treatment; and Assessing the effectiveness of that treatment. The Board, management and risk management committee will be responsible for implementing of mitigation plans<br />
                d) Monitoring, review and reporting<br />
                In order to ensure that risk management is effective and continues to support organizational performance, processes shall be established to:<br />
                 Measure risk management performance against the key risk indicators, which are periodically reviewed for appropriateness<br />
                 Periodically measure progress against, and deviation from, the risk management plan<br />
                 Periodically review whether the risk management framework, policy and plan are still appropriate, given the organizations&#39; external and internal context<br />
                 Report on risk, progress with the risk management plan and how well the risk management policy is being followed<br />
                 Periodically review the effectiveness of the risk management framework.<br />
                 Structured scientific and analytical tools may be used for this purpose.<br />
                Reporting is an integral part of any process and critical from a monitoring perspective. Results of risk assessment need to be reported to all relevant stake holders for review, inputs and monitoring.<br />
                e) Communication and consultation<br />
                Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that those accountable for implementing the risk management process and stakeholders understand the basis on which decisions are made, and the reasons why particular actions are required<br />
                f) Risk Reporting<br />
                The Risk Management Committee shall present an annual report to the Board summarizing its review of the Company’s risk management framework, key risks identified, treatment plans, and any deficiencies observed. The Audit Committee shall continue to provide oversight with respect to financial and compliance risks. The Board shall retain overall responsibility for risk governance and ensure corrective action where needed.
